# If a player gets one or more cards of the named rank that was asked for, 
they are entitled to ask the same or another player for a card. 
The player can ask for the same card or a different one. So long as the player 
succeeds in getting cards (makes a catch), their turn continues. 
When a player makes a catch, they must reveal the card so that the catch is verified. 
If a player gets the fourth card of a book, the player shows all four cards, 
places them on the table face up in front of everyone, and plays again.
